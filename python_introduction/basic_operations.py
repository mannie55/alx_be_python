#Assign specific values to the variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

#Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication with the variables
sum = number1 + number2
difference = number1 - number2
product = number1 * number2

#Print the result
print("Addition of", number1, "and", number2, "is", sum)
print("Subtraction of", number1, "and", number2, "is", difference)
print("Multiplication of", number1, "and", number2, "is", product)
